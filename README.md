# Predictive Modeling of Biomass Gasification Process with Machine Learning

This repository serves as a supplementary material for the following publication:

**Elmaz, Furkan, Özgün Yücel, and Ali Yener Mutlu. "Predictive modeling of biomass gasification with machine learning-based regression methods." Energy 191 (2020): 116541.  
DOI: [10.1016/j.energy.2019.116541](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.116541)**  

In order to utilize the pre-trained models, use main.py. One must note that the required 3 features for predictions should be
calculated with the PCA calculation given in the paper.
